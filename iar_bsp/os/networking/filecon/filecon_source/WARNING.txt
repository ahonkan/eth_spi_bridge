INFORMATION
===========

It was written specifically for the "webserv" product and therefore has
webserv-specific features such as file compress and security. The newer
version of "filecon" which we created for meant for general purpose use
and so we stipped out most of the compression and security related GUI
elements. The code related to these features is still present in the
source files.

This version of "filecon" takes a different approach to memory-files.
Along with the file data, it also generates code which can be used to
write the files to an actual file system (possibly the FILE ramdisk).
